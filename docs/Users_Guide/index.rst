**Foreword: A note to METdataio users**

This User's guide is provided as an aid to users of METdataio.  METdataio is a
Python rewrite of the capabilities in METviewer. The METviewer tool reads MET
verification statistics output from a database and creates plots using the R
statistical package. METdataio is also a component of the unified METplus
verification framework. More details about METplus can be found on the
`METplus website <http://dtcenter.org/community-code/metplus>`_.

It is important to note here that METdataio is an evolving software package.
This documentation describes the |release| release dated |release_date|.
Intermediate releases may include bug fixes. METdataio is also able to accept
new modules contributed by the community. If you have code you would like to
contribute, we will gladly consider your contribution. Please create a post
in the
`METplus GitHub Discussions Forum <https://github.com/dtcenter/METplus/discussions>`_.
We will then determine if we will be able to include the contribution in a
future version.

to the staff at the Developmental Testbed Center for their help, advice,
and many types of support. We released METplus Alpha in February 2017
and would not have made a decade of cutting-edge verification support
without those who participated in DTC planning workshops and the NGGPS
United Forecast System Strategic Implementation Plan Working Groups
(NGGPS UFS SIP WGs).
